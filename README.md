# Description:
# Chat-agents commonly known as the chatbots have gained immense attention from multiple fields. It is basically the participantsâ€™ queries and the responses received. Here in this paper we have discussed about having a chatbot in educational institution. When considering an institution regardless, whether it is a school or university it is consequential that the students are edified in a congruous environment. This generalizes that the infrastructure should fascinate every requisite as cardinal or required by the students or the faculty in that environment.
# Present day process implies that all the work is done manually and is bound to wreak mistakes. In order to minimize the mistakes it is predictable to have a computer availed web-predicted system that will invigilate the infrastructure allotment taking these factors into consideration. The system will thereby contribute in reducing the manual efforts taken by the time-table coordinator and also the time taken for the process. We aim at providing a system that will be effective for institutions, so that henceforth rather than doing the work manually, the system will be made use of.
